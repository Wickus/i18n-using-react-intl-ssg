# Internationalising (i18n) Next.js project using [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/)
This is a simple example of how to use `react-intl` in your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project. You will be able to implement this in your [React](https://reactjs.org/) project as well.

## Usage
- Open your terminal
- Clone the project using `git clone`
- Open the directory in the terminal and run `npm i`
- After the packages installed run `npm run dev` for the server hosted project
- Run `npm run build` this will run `next build && next export` to generate the static site to the `/out` folder

## How to run static site from `/out` folder
- Install `http-server` using the `npm i -g http-server` command to add it globally
- After the package is installed got to the `/out` directory and run `http-server` to host your static site locally on port `:8080`
